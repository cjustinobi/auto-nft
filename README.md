## Introduction

Using Oracle services like Chainlink seems to be the go-to platform when one is faced with the task of doing some automation 
and running CRON jobs on one's dApp. 

The challenge comes when your preferred blockchain in not supported by Chainlink or 
some of the alternative oracle platforms, hence looking at how to get going with OpenZepplin Defender.
OpenZepplin Defender handles automation and much more.

This project demonstrates how to build an automated Dynamic NFT system using Celo Composer and the OpenZeppelin Defender.
